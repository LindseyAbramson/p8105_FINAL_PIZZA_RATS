<p>This scatterplot displays the relationship between pizza restaurant
count and rat sightings for every zipcode. Each point represents one
zipcode, and the color indicates the number of rat reports. Most points
cluster at lower values for both variables, while a few zipcodes show
very high rat activity. The wide spread of the points shows that the
relationship is weak and that many other factors likely contribute to
rat sightings.</p>
<p><img src="plotlyfinal_files/figure-html/top10-rats-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>This bar chart highlights the ten zipcodes with the highest number of
rat sightings. A few locations stand out with much higher counts than
the rest of the city. These areas may have environmental or structural
conditions that support larger rat populations. This chart helps
identify where rat issues are most concentrated.</p>

<p>This bar chart shows the ten zipcodes with the highest number of
pizza restaurants. These areas often have dense food activity and heavy
foot traffic. When compared with the rat sightings chart, it becomes
clear that zipcodes with many pizza restaurants do not always have the
highest rat activity. This supports the idea that pizza restaurant
density is not a strong predictor of rat reports across zipcodes.</p>

<p>This plot shows the estimated linear relationship between the number
of pizza restaurants in a zipcode and the predicted number of rat
sightings. The line slopes upward, which suggests a small positive
association. The confidence band is wide, which shows that there is a
lot of uncertainty around the predicted values. This means pizza
restaurant count alone does not explain much of the variation in rat
sightings across the city. The R squared value of 0.07 means that the
number of pizza restaurants in these zipcodes explains only about seven
percent of the variation in rat sighting reports. This shows that the
relationship between these two variables is very weak. While there is a
small positive trend, most of the differences in rat activity across
zipcodes are due to other factors that are not included in this
model.</p>
