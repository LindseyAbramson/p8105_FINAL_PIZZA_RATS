To examine how rat sightings and pizza restaurants are spatially distributed, we obtained a NYC shapefile from NYC government data portal. This shapefile included the geometric shapes of each zipcode area and an attribute table that included the zipcode numbers for each shape. We merged this shapefile with our cleaned dataset using the common variable of zipcodes. 


```{r loading and merging data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

# Zip code shapefile
zip_nyc =
  st_read("maps/MODZCTA_2010.shp") |> 
  rename(zipcode = MODZCTA) |> 
  select(zipcode, geometry)

# Basic plot
basic = 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = zip_nyc)

# Dissolving shapefile for just NYC boundary
NYC <- st_union(zip_nyc)

# Loading rat and restaurant data
zipcode_summary <- read_csv("data_small/zipcode_summary.csv") |> 
  mutate(
    zipcode = as.character(zipcode)
  )

# Joining rat and restaurant data with shapefile. Now, I have one file with the geometries for the map, and rat and pizza count data.
nyc_rat_pizza =
  zip_nyc |> 
  left_join(zipcode_summary, by = "zipcode")

```

### Rat Sightings Map

To create a heatmap of rat sightings across NYC, we first had to assess the distribution of the `ratreport_count` variable in our dataset. As demonstrated below, `rareport_count` is right skewed, with most zipcodes reporting anywhere from 0 to 200 sightings. Due to the skewed nature of this variable, when categorizing our data for the heatmap, we used a natural breaks jenks approach to ensure zipcodes with similar rat sightings are visually represented using the same color.  

```{r rat map base map, include = FALSE}
# Rat count base map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = nyc_rat_pizza,
    aes(fill = ratreport_count),
    color = "black",
    linewidth = .2
  ) 
```

```{r Rat sightings distribution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Examining distribution to figure out how to categorize data
nyc_rat_pizza |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ratreport_count)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "# of Rat Sightings",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Distribution of Rat Sightings Variable"
  )

```


```{r rat map breaks, include = FALSE}
# Right skewed data so using natural break jenks as opposed to quantiles
breaks_rat <- classIntervals(nyc_rat_pizza$ratreport_count, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
print(breaks_rat)
```

The final step was to refine the formatting and styling of the heatmap to ensure clear and effective visualization.

```{r formatted rat map, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Formatted Rat Map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(                            # setting rat counts as my fill             
    data = nyc_rat_pizza,
    aes(fill = ratreport_count),
    color = "white",
    linewidth = .05
  )  +
  scale_fill_fermenter(               # indicating the color palette for the rat sightings map
    direction = 1,
    palette = "Greens",
    breaks = breaks_rat
  ) +
  geom_sf(                            # adding a thin black outline around map
    data = NYC,
    fill = NA,
    color = "black",
    linewidth = 0.03
  ) +
  labs(                                # adding title and subtitle 
    title = "Number of Rat Sightings in \nNew York City by Zipcode, 2025",
    subtitle = "Sightings as of November 2025", 
    fill = "Number of Sightings"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(                             # title and subtitle formatting and placement
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13, family = "sans", vjust = -20),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", size = 11, vjust = -3.5),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "inside",
    legend.position.inside = c(0.2, 0.6),
    legend.key.size = unit(.4, 'cm'),
    plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0),        
    panel.spacing = unit(0, "pt")            
  ) + 
  annotation_scale(                   # adding a scale bar
    style = "ticks",   
    pad_x = unit(1.4, "in"),
    pad_y = unit(.3, "in"),
    unit_category = "imperial"
  ) +
  annotation_north_arrow(             # adding a north arrow
    height = unit(.8, "cm"),
    width = unit(1, "cm"),
    pad_x = unit(1, "in"), 
    pad_y = unit(0.2, "in"),
    style = north_arrow_minimal 
    )  -> map_rat
```


### Pizza Restuarants Map

A similar approach was taken to create the pizza restaurants map. We first assessed the distribution of the `pizzarestaurant_count` variable in our dataset. We found that this variable was also right skewed, with most zip codes ranging from 0-50 pizza restaurants. We also used natural breaks jenks to categorize `pizzarestaurant_count`.

```{r restaurant map base map, include = FALSE}
# Pizza count base map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = nyc_rat_pizza,
    aes(fill = pizzarestaurant_count),
    color = "black",
    linewidth = .2
  )
```


```{r restaurant distribution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Examine distribution to figure out how to categorize data
nyc_rat_pizza |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = pizzarestaurant_count)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkred", color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "# of Pizza Restaurants",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Distribution of Pizza Resturants Variable"
  )
```


```{r restaurant breaks, include = FALSE}
# Right skewed so using natural break jenks
breaks_pizza <- classIntervals(nyc_rat_pizza$pizzarestaurant_count, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
print(breaks_pizza)

```

The final step was to refine the formatting and styling of the heatmap to ensure clear and effective visualization.

```{r restaurant map formatted, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Formatted Pizza Map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(                              # setting pizza counts as my fill
    data = nyc_rat_pizza,
    aes(fill = pizzarestaurant_count),
    color = "white",
    linewidth = .05
  )  +
  scale_fill_fermenter(                # indicating color palette
    direction = 1,
    palette = "Reds",
    breaks = breaks_pizza
  ) +
  geom_sf(                             # adding black border around map
    data = NYC,
    fill = NA,
    color = "black",
    linewidth = 0.03
  )  +
  labs(                                # adding title and subtitle 
    title = "Number of Pizza Restaurants \nin New York City by Zipcode, 2025",
    subtitle = "Includes by-the-slice and\nsit-down pizza restuarants", 
    fill = "Number of Pizza Restaurants"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(                              # formatting and placement of title, subtitle, legend
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13, family = "sans", vjust = -20),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", size = 11, vjust = -25),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "inside",
    legend.position.inside = c(0.2, 0.6),
    legend.key.size = unit(.4, 'cm'),
    plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0),        
    panel.spacing = unit(0, "pt")            
  ) +
  annotation_scale(                   # adding a scale bar
    style = "ticks",   
    pad_x = unit(1.4, "in"),
    pad_y = unit(.3, "in"),
    unit_category = "imperial"
  ) +
  annotation_north_arrow(             # adding a north arrow
    height = unit(.8, "cm"),
    width = unit(1, "cm"),
    pad_x = unit(1, "in"), 
    pad_y = unit(0.2, "in"),
    style = north_arrow_minimal 
    )  -> map_pizza
```

### Results

These maps illustrate the spatial distribution of rat sightings and pizza restaurants across New York City zipcodes. Most rat sightings are concentrated in central Brooklyn, particularly in neighborhoods such as Flatbush, Prospect Heights, and Bedford-Stuyvesant. A few zipcodes in the West Bronx and around Morningside Heights also show elevated rat activity.

In contrast, the distribution of pizza restaurants is more dispersed. Zipcodes with the highest numbers of pizza restaurants are spread across Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, in neighborhoods such as Hell’s Kitchen, Jackson Heights, Flatbush, and Long Island City.

There is only one zipcode with both a high number of rat sightings and a high number of pizza restaurants (11226, Flatbush). This suggests that pizza restaurant count alone may not be a strong predictor of rat activity. Other neighborhood-level factors must be contributing to variation in rat sightings across NYC.
