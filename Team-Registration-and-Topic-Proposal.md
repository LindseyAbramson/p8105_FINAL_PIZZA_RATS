Team Registration and Proposal
================
2025-11-04

### The group members (names and UNIs):

- Lindsey Abramson (lca2149)
- Vaidehi Chudgar (vc2692)
- Jake Vettoretti(jpv2129)
- Rachel Novick (ren2121)

### The tentative project title:

“RatStats: Data by the Slice”

### The motivation for this project:

We hope to figure out how much NYC rats like pizza! And in a similar
manner hope to inform rat lovers where they can enjoy pizza alongside
their furry friends.

### The intended final products:

Website with our report, maps, plots, etc.

### The anticipated data sources:

We will be using data from 2025 from NYC Open Data. We will analyze the
rat sightings data set alongside the restaurant inspection data set. See
below:

- <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data>

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:

We plan on running a linear regression with out two continuous variables
(prevalence of rats (exposure) and prevalence of pizza restaurants
(outcome)). We will shoot for all of NYC but then may modify down to a
single borough if necessary.

Our visualizations will include a final map with data from both data
sets to gain a clear understanding of where rats overlap the most with
pizza restaurants. Our plots will include a scatter plot with a
regression line showing the correlation between rat sightings and pizza
restaurants. We will also include a heat map.

Some predicted coding challenges may include missing data. We plan on
analyzing our two data sets by zipcode and therefore may find that there
are some zipcodes present in one data set but not the other. Other
coding challenges might include corrupted data by the rat czar!!

### The planned timeline:

- Week of 11/10: Meet with faculty / TA to discuss project.
- Week of 11/17: Import and clean data sets
- Week of 11/24: Create visualizations and plots
- 12/4: Website Complete and report written
- 12/5: Screen cast Recording
- 12/6: Final project due.
