## Motivation

Our research team was motivated by the intense desire to understand the gustatory preferences of our NYC rodent counterparts. With a wealth of publicly available data, we endeavored to take a deep delve into the association between prevalence of pizza restaurants and frequency of rat sightings across zipcodes in New York City.

## Exploratory Analysis

Visually exploring the distribution of rat sightings and pizza restaurants across zip codes using heat maps, we see an inconsistent spatial relationship between areas with a high density of both pizza serving establishments and rats. These visual ques were early indicators that where NYC rats choose to spend their leisure time may be more accurately predicted by factors other than access to cheesy, saucy confections.

To further examine the linear relationship between number of pizza restaurants and number of rat sightings, we calculated the R-squared. The R-squared value of 0.07 indicates that only 7% of the variation in the number of rat sightings can be explained by the number of pizza restaurants in a given zip code, and 93% is explained by other factors. The weak effect of pizza establishments on prevalence of rats was a surprise to the team at the Pizza Rat Research Institute at Columbia Mailman, therefore further statistical testing was necessitated. 

## Additional analysis

We analyzed the relationship between pizza restaurant count and number of rat sightings using linear regression.

We regressed number of rat sightings against number of pizza restaurants, and obtained a parameter estimate and associated p-value. We found that for each additional pizza restaurant per zip code, number of rat sightings increased by an average of 1.16 (p-value = 0.001). Our analysis showed that number of pizza establishments is positively and significantly associated with number of rat sightings, though the effect is weak.

## Discussion

Our study demonstrates that while there is a statistically significant positive association between availability of pizza, as operationalized by number of pizza serving establishments, and number of rat sightings, the relationship is not strong in a predictive sense. 

This study has several limitations. This analysis is limited by substantial surveillance and detection bias, as rat sightings rely on 311 reports, which reflect where people look for rats—not necessarily where rats actually are. Likewise, areas with more pizza restaurants may simply have more pedestrian traffic, increasing the probability of rat detection rather than true rat abundance. The study is also susceptible to ecological fallacy and residual confounding, since neighborhood-level counts of pizza shops correlate with population density, waste management practices, and a host of unmeasured urban quirks that jointly shape rodent ecology. Finally, pervasive spatial autocorrelation means rats—and the humans who spot them—rarely respect census-tract boundaries, complicating interpretation and inviting caution before attributing any causal power to pizza.

Further research is needed to understand the culinary preferences of rats in New York City.
